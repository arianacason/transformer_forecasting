Time Series Forecasting with Transformers
This repository contains a Python implementation of a Transformer model for time series forecasting. This project can be utilized for forecasting future values from historical sequential data, such as financial markets, weather patterns, and even lottery number predictions. The model uses a custom Transformer architecture capable of understanding complex temporal dependencies in the data.

Project Structure
transformer_forecasting.py: Main script containing the code for data preprocessing, model building, training, and predictions.
data/: Directory for storing sample datasets. Replace or add your specific time series data in CSV format here.
requirements.txt: Lists all Python libraries required to run the project.
Features
Data Preprocessing: Converts raw time series data into a format suitable for supervised learning.
Custom Transformer Model: Implements a Transformer using multi-head attention to capture patterns at different positions in the data.
Flexible Data Handling: Adapts easily to various types of time series data with minimal adjustments.
Multiple Predictions: Configurable to output multiple future predictions at once.
Installation
Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed on your machine. Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/transformer-time-series-forecasting.git
cd transformer-time-series-forecasting
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Add your time series dataset to the data/ directory and ensure it's in CSV format.
Update the dataset path in transformer_forecasting.py to your dataset location.
Run the script:

python transformer_forecasting.py


Configuration
To adapt the model to different datasets or requirements, modify the following parameters in transformer_forecasting.py:

Data Path: Change 'path_to_your_lottery_data.csv' to the path of your specific dataset.
n_in and n_out in series_to_supervised: Adjust these parameters to change how many past time steps to look at (n_in) and how many future time steps to predict (n_out).
Normalization: Modify the MinMaxScaler range if different scaling is required based on the dataset characteristics.
Model Architecture: Change the number of layers, dimensions of the Transformer, number of heads, etc., to scale up or down based on the complexity and size of the data.
Epochs and Batch Size: Adjust these in the model training section to fine-tune the learning process.
Model Details
The Transformer model architecture in this project includes:

MultiHeadAttention: Focuses on different positions of the input sequence, important for understanding the full context of the sequence.
LayerNormalization and Dropout: Help in stabilizing the learning process and preventing overfitting.
Dense Layers: Transform the output of the Transformer block into the final prediction.
